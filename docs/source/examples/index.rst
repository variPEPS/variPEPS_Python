.. _examples:


Overview
========

We provide several examples in the `examples/ folder of the variPEPS Git
repository <https://github.com/variPEPS/variPEPS_Python/tree/main/examples>`_
that demonstrate how to use the code for variational energy optimization in
typical 2D many-body problems.

In the documentation we include a commented version of the examples with a
detailed description of the model and the consideration how to call the library.
