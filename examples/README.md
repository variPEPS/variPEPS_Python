# Examples

In this folder we provide some examples how to use the variPEPS library. The
examples are provided as

1. The raw Python script which can be just been executed by calling `python3
   <script>.py` after installation of the `varipeps` package and
2. A Jupyter notebook file containing a verbose description of the example. To
   use this version an installation of the `jupyter` package is required.
